He has a healthy love for chicken and fish, and will love you forever if you have long nails and a heating pad."

But once she's comfortable in her surroundings, she is a joy to have around. She loves long walks, treeing squirrels, wrestling and playing rough with you and other dogs, and is obsessed with peanut butter. Minnie's cutest trait is that she sighs and grumbles in her sleep - very loudly."

He could recognize the sound of the UPS truck engine and squealing brakes from a half-block away, so we always knew when a package was coming - for anyone in our neighborhood. He had a tough last year of his life, but was still happy until the last day."
