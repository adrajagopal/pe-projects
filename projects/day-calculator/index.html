	<h1>How I plan my day</h1>
	<h2>Or: using numbers to light a fire under your ass</h2>
	<h3>The problem</h3>
	<p>While taking time off from work, I often found that if I didn't plan my days carefully, they would disappear without me even noticing. I would wake up around 7am, and before I knew it, it was 4pm and I couldn't remember what I had done that day.</p>
	<p>Without structure, it feels like the day is endless. You wake up with about 15 hours to do whatever you want.</p>

	>
	<p>But when you add a couple of restraints, you start to see how limited your day is. Check out the table below:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Activity</strong></td>
			<td><strong>Time required</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Sleep</td>
			<td>7-9 hours</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Meals</td>
			<td>2 hours</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Work</td>
			<td>8 hours (or more)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Exercise</td>
			<td>30 min - 2 hours</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Chores</td>
			<td>1-2 hours</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Basic hygiene*</td>
			<td>1 hour hours</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
		<p>Before you know it, you lose a bunch of time.</p>

		<h3>The (overengineered) solution</h3>
		<p>I customized a Google Sheet to plug in my daily time commitments, and write down the things I want to accomplish every morning. Google Sheets is just easy for math, but you can do it by hand, too.</p>
		<p>You can find the sheet

				>here</a>, and copy it for your own use. I've made it view-only for the iFrame.</p>
