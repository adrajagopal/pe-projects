		<h1>Things I Love</h1>
		<p>My favorite things...hmmm. I love my wife and my dogs, but they're not really "things".</p>
		<p>I love playing music, being outdoors, and getting active. I love spending time with my loved ones. I really love bluegrass music. I love all food.</p>
		<p>I love learning and I love conquering my fears. I love proving to myself that I can do things that I didn't think I could. I love to start each day thinking about what I want to accomplish by the time I got to bed. I love thinking about why I didn't get everything done, and whether that's OK.</p>
