		<h1>My Learning Journey</h1>
		<h2>It's been almost a month of PE!</h2>
		<p>So far, things have not gotten scary. I finished the entire HTML section of the Odin Project Foundations course, so while there's plenty I don't recognize, it doesn't feel completely foreign to me. I think that's all going to change when we hit CSS.</p>
		<p>Design still feels very squishy and overwhelming to me. I think the biggest thing is that I really recognize how <em>thoughtful</em> you have to be in everything you do, and that leaves so many decisions to be made! I totally understand why there are so many suboptimal user experiences out there.</p>
		<p>That being said, I'm still very excited!</p>
