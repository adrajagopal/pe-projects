		<h1>Check out some of my favorite apps.</h1>
		<h2>From music to groceries to hiking, these apps are simple, practical, and (mostly) free.</h2>
		<p><a href='https://overcast.fm/' target='_blank'>Overcast</a> is a free podcast app that is highly customizable and extremely chill. No discovery algorithms, no aggressive ad play, and it doesn't hide the list of shows you've downloaded. You can hide the ads for $10/year, but they're so non-invasive that I can't even find them half the time.</p>
		<p><a href='https://spotify.com/' target='_blank'>Spotify</a> gets a lot of hate for being a massive business that pays artists pennies on the dollar. I recognize this, but I also don't think there's any better way to listen to such a vast volume of artists. Also...their algorithms are  not bad. I think it's the most useful algorithm and is well-aligned with your incentives as a listener. Lastly - just pay for Premium. The ad experience is horrendous.</p>
		<p><a href='https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby' target='_blank'>Libby</a> is a great app that pulls from your local public library. You can reserve and read audiobooks and ebooks. The selection doesn't always reflect what's available in your brick and mortar library, but it's solid. The app is free, but you do have to have a library card. I think most people should stop paying for books that they're only going to read once. It's nice to support authors, but it's also nice to support libraries and not hoard physical objects.</p>
		<p><a href='https://sheets.google.com' target='_blank'>Google Sheets (free*)</a> - because you don't <em>really</em> need Excel anymore, unless you use it for your job.</p>
		<p><a href='https://www.ourgroceries.com/overview' target='_blank'>OurGroceries</a> is a simple, no-nonsense groceries app with a solid free tier. The main features of the app have basically remained the same for the 3-4 years I've had the app. You can pay to have shared lists with family members, but totally unnecessary.</p>
		<p><a href='https://www.alltrails.com/' target='_blank'>AllTrails</a> is an outdoors app for discovering trails of all kinds - hiking, biking, paddling, and whatever else. The paid tier has some fancy stuff, like offline maps and live location tracking along routes.</p>
		<p><a href='https://www.1password.com/' target='_blank'>1Password</a> is the best password manager. Pay for it and be done with it.</p>
		<p><a href='https://www.notion.so' target='_blank'>Notion</a> is kind of an...everything app? I got it for notetaking, and it's fantastic for that. But it's also great for planning events, project organization, goal tracking, etc. And the Notion AI is really good at formatting (lol).</p>
		<p>*free is how some people would describe Google products. Others would decidedly not do so.</p>
