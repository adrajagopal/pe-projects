		<p class="medium-voice">I'm coming to webdev with 7 years of experience in analytics, consulting and product management in the healthcare space.</p>
	
		<p>I've always worked on small-but-growing teams, whether that's deeply embedded in a corporation of 80,000 employees, or as the first IC product manager of a seed-stage startup.</p>
	
		<p>My former clients, colleagues, and managers have described me as "the most organized person I've ever met", attentive to detail, proactive, brilliant, and a joy to be around.</p>

		<p><strong>How will you describe me?</strong></p>
