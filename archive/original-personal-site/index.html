		<h1>Hi there.</h1>
		<h2>I've been working on some things. Thanks for stopping by.</h2>
		<h3>About me</h3>
		<p>I'm a generalist extraordinaire, but most recently spent about 2.5 years as a product manager. I've always thought about going deep and specializing in something - something technical - and it took a full 5 years to learn about frontend and web development. It took another 2 years after that to burn out and work up the courage to give it a shot.</p>

		<p>So this is me giving it a shot.</p>
		
		<h3>Sample projects</h3>
		<!-- <p>All of these projects serve different purposes, each one focusing on a specific skillset I developed during my coursework. None of them are perfect, and all of them were a blast.</p> -->
		<ul>
			<!-- <li class="bulleted-list"><a href="projects/4-page-website/index.html">Basic four-page website</a></li> -->
			<!-- <li class="bulleted-list"><a href="projects/web-portal/index.html">Web portal</a></li> -->
			<li class="bulleted-list"><a href="projects/day-calculator/index.html">Day calculator</a></li>
			<li class="bulleted-list">More coming soon...</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Get in touch</h3>
		<p>If you'd like to talk about my work, my plans for a job, or anything else - get in touch.</p>
		<p>Send me an <a href="mailto:adrajagopal@gmail.com">email</a>, or subscribe to my newsletter below.</p>
