<p class="medium-voice">I'm a web developer. I'm coming to webdev with 7 years of experience in analytics, consulting and product management in the healthcare space. I've always worked on small-but-growing teams, whether that's deeply embedded in a corporation of 80,000 employees, or as the first IC product manager of a pre-seed startup. My former clients, colleagues, and managers would (and have!) described me as extremely organized, attentive to detail, proactive, brilliant, and a joy to be around. What will you say?</p>
