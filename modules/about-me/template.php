	<h3 class="large-voice">About me</h3>

	<p>I'm a visually-oriented developer who loves making great designs come alive. I have a background in analytics, visual design and product management, and I'm looking for a development role where I can contribute throughout the build cycle -- including <em>before</em> any code gets written.</p>

	<p>I love working with designers, product managers (I used to be one, so I'm not afraid of them ðŸ˜‰), and engineers; I thrive on early and frequent feedback. My greatest strengths are my attention to detail, organization, and proactivity.</p>
