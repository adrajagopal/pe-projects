	<h2 class="xl-voice">About me</h2>

	<p>I'm a visually-oriented developer who loves making great designs come alive. I have a background in analytics and product management in the digital health space, and I'm looking for a development role where I can contribute throughout the build cycle -- including <em>before</em> any code gets written.</p>

	<p>I love working with designers, engineers, stakeholders and product managers (I used to be one, so I'm not afraid of them ðŸ˜‰); I thrive on early and frequent feedback. My greatest strengths are my attention to detail, organization, and proactivity.</p>

	<p>If you'd like to work together, talk about <a href="https://github.com/adrajagopal" target="_blank">my work</a>, or just chat about design & code, get in touch with me via <a href="mailto:adrajagopal@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-rajagopal-a68b8281/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
