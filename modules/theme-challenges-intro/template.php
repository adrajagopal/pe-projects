<h3 class="large-voice">Theme & layout projects</h3>

<p>These projects are heavily focused on CSS. Each project covers the basics - margins, padding, image sizing, color/contrast and typography - and then goes all the way into responsive design using grid, flexbox, and positioning. In the middle, there are the little details.</p>

		<p><a href="projects/mockup-to-code-challenge">Figma to Code Challenge</a> - a one-week sprint to prove that I can take a figma file and build 3 responsive landing pages while matching the design perfectly - spoiler, I only matched the pieces I agreed with. I pushed back on elements of the design that I couldn't complete in the allotted time, or didn't make sense when you added in a responsive layout, or just didn't look good once implemented. It was also an exercise in using JSON to drive templates and page content.

		<p><a href="projects/style-guide">Style Guide</a> - style guides are used to show how a design system would look for a given set of content. This includes typography (font sizes, weights, styles; letter spacing and line height; "voicings"), colors & contrast, component styling, and content spacing. The more content, the more comprehensive the guide.
