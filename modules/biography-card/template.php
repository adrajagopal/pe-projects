		<h3 class="large-voice">Biography:</h3>

		<p>This version of Ad appears most of the time. He’s a hyper-organized, analytics-loving, former product manager with an obsessive attention to detail. He takes a lot of pride in handcrafting things himself, which is why he’d rather be coding than writing product briefs.</p>

		<p>He loves feeling like part of a team and making your days (and meetings) a little more joyful.</p>
