		<p class="medium-voice">I'm a frontend developer with 7 years of experience in consulting and product management in the healthcare space.</p>
	
		<p>I've taken products and features from brainstorm to launch, helping companies find patients with rare diseases, helping gastrointestinal patients connect with their providers virtually, and working with designers, engineers and data scientists to get it all done.</p>
	
		<p>My former clients, colleagues, and managers have described me as "the most organized person I've ever met", attentive to detail, proactive, brilliant, and a joy to be around.</p>
