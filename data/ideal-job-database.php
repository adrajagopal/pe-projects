I haven't picked a specific direction yet, but I think playing music and spending time outdoors are probably at the top of my list.

			"description" => "Finally, a buzzword!! But really, I just want to feel like I’m in control of my life and my work. And I want to own the benefits of my work. So many people feel like they work their entire careers for someone else, and they don’t have much to show for it. The money, the skills, the time — I don’t want to work for someone who takes all of that from me without giving back much to me"
