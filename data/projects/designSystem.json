In my previous life as a product manager, I was responsible for the engineering side of our marketing pages. We didnâ€™t have a UI editor set up yet, so when our marketing team wanted to make changes (which happened multiple times a week), we had to make changes directly in the code. With that experience in mind, I structured this project in a way that would allow a developer to quickly swap out components, links, and update copy without having to make major changes to the code."
